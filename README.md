- I have created the task using Cypress with cucumber.

- I have created one feature file for the task and divided the required task into 3 main scenarios.

- I have created background steps for the login feature as it's a repeatable step so I put it in the background activities.

- I have created assertions for each step.

- My idea for getting the records and checking if the user has added or deleted is to get the current user record as the initial number and then after adding a new user 
                I fetch the new count and compare it to the initial one, then I add the count to the initial variable to update its value and vice versa for the delete.
